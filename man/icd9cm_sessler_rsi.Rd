\alias{icd9cm_sessler_rsi}
\title{Returns composite Sessler risk stratification index, given a list of ICD-9-CM codes.}
\usage{
icd9cm_sessler_rsi(icd9)
}
\arguments{
\item{icd9}{a unique character vector of ICD-9-CM codes}
}
\value{
The risk stratification index score
}
\description{
ICD-9-CM codes must have periods removed.  Diagnostic codes are prefixed with
'D' while procedure codes are prefixed with 'P'. So, diagnostic code
\code{404.03} should be \code{"D40403"}.
}
\details{
Note: A subsequent publication (Sigakis, 2013) found the following:
"Calibration "in-the-large" for RSI in-hospitalmortality illustrated a discrepancy
between actual (1.5%) and predicted (51.7%) in-hospital mortality. The authors
identified a regression constant (-2.198) in the published RSI
"all-covariates.xls" file that was not used in the published SPSS implementation
macro."
}
\examples{
# Calculate RSI for each patient ("id") in dataframe
cases <- data.frame(id=c(1,1,1,2,2,2),
  icd9cm=c("D20206","D24220","D4439","D5064","DE8788","D40403"))
library(plyr)
ddply(cases, .(id), function(x) { icd9cm_sessler_rsi(x$icd9cm) } )
